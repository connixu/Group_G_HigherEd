## Project Description:  
After Biden's recent announcement of a federal student laon cancellation program, many people are pushing for universal student laon forgiveness. However, there's still a lot of uncertainty in this area. Looking at this topic from both a historical and a socioeconomic perspective would shed light on the contemporary discussion of student loan forgiveness policy.  
  
This project explores how student debt and its repayment rate interact with socioeconomic conditions. This was a really broad topic so we did a decent amount of data exploration before zooming in our research focus. The project involves three parts. First, We focus on specific aspects of the student loan issue including university selectivity, family income, repayment rate over time, and the regional difference of debt amount to understand why student debt becomes a more and more serious problem that people in US now are highly concerned with. After looking at the historical data, we also want to understand the current discussion on student loan forgiveness in light of the Biden administration's recent announcement of a $1 Billion cancellation in student loans. Specifically, we looked at the tweets keywords and examined if there's an overlap between states that are most concerned about student debt and where the selective schools are located in the US.
